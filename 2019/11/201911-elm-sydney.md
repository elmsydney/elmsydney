If you're Twitter-inclined please let tonight's speakers know how much you appreciate the work they put in by tweeting about it. Giving feedback definitely makes the speakers feel their efforts have made an impact beyond building their own presentation portfolio. Don't forget to mention elmsydney to tie the night altogether.

# [fit] Who's **New?**
# [fit] Say **Hello!** :wave:

^
So if you're new to Elm Sydney can you please put up your hand, don't worry we're not going to make you stand up or say anything.  Everyone have a look around at any new people standing near you with their hands up. We're going to have a 5 minute break, so please welcome them, and we'll kick off the talks.

# [fit] *Next Meetup's* Exercism
# [fit] **Nucleotide Count**

# [fit] *`exercism download --exercise=raindrops --track=elm`*

^
Next months challenge is "Raindrops", where you convert a number to a string, the contents of which depend on the number's factors.<br />
If the number has 3 as a factor, output 'Pling'.<br />
If the number has 5 as a factor, output 'Plang'.<br />
If the number has 7 as a factor, output 'Plong'.<br />
If the number does not have 3, 5, or 7 as a factor, just pass the number's digits straight through.<br />

# [fit] **Thank you!**

^
Thanks so much to all the speakers tonight, and if anyone is interested in giving a talk at a future Elm Sydney...

---

# [fit] We are always looking for
# [fit] **SPEAKERS!**

^
We are looking for speakers!
- We want *you* to present something at Elm Sydney because presenting here is a win/win situation. You, the speaker, practice a skill and learn new things, and we, the audience, leverage your knowledge to learn new things that can potentially help us.<br />
- It's great public speaking practice in front of an audience that wants you to succeed because we're all here to learn cool new things, and...<br />
- Any talk you present here is great fodder for your resume and portfolio, and just by virtue of presenting, everyone will think you're an expert, which will surely lead to at least an endorsement on LinkedIn<br />
- So if you've got something to say, or to show and tell, that you think the Elm community would love to hear about...

something different, and who knows, you might even end up liking it and wanting
to do more.<br />
- Also, if you need any help creating or critiquing your presentation or want someone to do a dry run, then please feel free to approach any of the Elm Sydney organisers and we're happy to help you in any way we can to make you look awesome up on stage.

# [fit] Next Meetup
# [fit] **February 2020**
# [fit] *at* **DiUS**

^
The next Elm meetup will be in February 2020. We haven't set the timetable in stone yet, but it will probably be the same as always, here at DiUS for as long as they are okay to have us. More details on timetabling will be available soon-ish, but when we lock it down we will announce it on Twitter and Meetup.
Please make sure to clean up after yourself and put your plates in the rubbish bins and empty bottles in the recycling bins. Thanks for coming along, hope you have an amazing year-end break, and we hope to see you next year!
