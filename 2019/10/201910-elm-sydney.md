If you're Twitter-inclined please let tonight's speakers know how much you appreciate the work they put in by tweeting about it. Giving feedback definitely makes the speakers feel their efforts have made an impact beyond building their own presentation portfolio. Don't forget to mention elmsydney to tie the night altogether.

# [fit] Who's **New?**
# [fit] Say **Hello!** :wave:

^
So if you're new to Elm Sydney can you please put up your hand, don't worry we're not going to make you stand up or say anything.  Everyone have a look around at any new people standing near you with their hands up. We're going to have a 5 minute break, so please welcome them, and we'll kick off the talks.

# [fit] **Thank you!**

^
Thanks so much to all the speakers tonight, and if anyone is interested in giving a talk at a future Elm Sydney...

---

# [fit] We are always looking for
# [fit] **SPEAKERS!**

^
We are looking for speakers!
- We want *you* to present something at Elm Sydney because presenting here is a win/win situation. You, the speaker, practice a skill and learn new things, and we, the audience, leverage your knowledge to learn new things that can potentially help us.<br />
- It's great public speaking practice in front of an audience that wants you to succeed because we're all here to learn cool new things, and...<br />
- Any talk you present here is great fodder for your resume and portfolio, and just by virtue of presenting, everyone will think you're an expert, which will surely lead to at least an endorsement on LinkedIn<br />
- So if you've got something to say, or to show and tell, that you think the Elm community would love to hear about...

- Open up an issue at the new Elm Sydney Github repo and tell us about the talk you want to submit, or feel free to message any of the organisers.<br />
- Remember, It is *good* to throw yourself out of your comfort zone and try
something different, and who knows, you might even end up liking it and wanting
to do more.<br />
- Also, if you need any help creating or critiquing your presentation or want someone to do a dry run, then please feel free to approach any of the Elm Sydney organisers and we're happy to help you in any way we can to make you look awesome up on stage.

# [fit] Next Meetup
# [fit] **28 November 2019**
# [fit] *\(4th Thursday of the month\)*
# [fit] *at* **DiUS**

^
The next meetup is planned for the 28th of November, right here at DiUS, and this will be the final meetup of this year. The 4th Thursday is Boxing Day, so I'm sure you'll all be too busy with Christmas presents to worry about meetups, and January is an off month for the meetup, so we will start up 2020 in February. So, if you want to get in an Elm talk this year, next month is the time to do it, otherwise, you have plenty of time to get something ready by February.
Please make sure to clean up after yourself and put your plates in the rubbish bins and empty bottles in the recycling bins. Thanks for coming along and we hope to see you next month!
