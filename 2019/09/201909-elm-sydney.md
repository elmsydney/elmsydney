Welcome to Elm Sydney.

### Talks
### Tips / Jobs
### Pub/Hacking/Hanging Out?

We're going to kick off tonight with a couple of talks, hastily put together, but we're hoping to get more in the coming meetups, including ones from you!<br />
After the talks, we'll throw it out to the group to cover tips, tricks and jobs opportunities.<br />
Then it's off to the pub, or maybe hacking, or maybe hanging out, depending on how long we go.

# [fit] **Thanks** to our
# [fit] **Sponsors**

Elm Sydney requires sponsors otherwise these meetups would not be possible (or you'd have to pay for them), so we would very much like to thank...

If you're Twitter-inclined please let tonight's speakers know how much you appreciate the work they put in by tweeting about it. Giving feedback definitely makes the speakers feel their efforts have made an impact beyond building their own presentation portfolio. Don't forget to mention elmsydney to tie the night altogether.

# [fit] Who's **New?**
# [fit] Say **Hello!** :wave:

^
So if you're new to Elm Sydney can you please put up your hand, don't worry we're not going to make you stand up or say anything.  Everyone have a look around at any new people standing near you with their hands up. We're going to have a 5 minute break, so please welcome them, and we'll kick off the talks.

# [fit] *Next Meetup's* Exercism
# [fit] **Leap**

# [fit] *`exercism download --exercise=leap --track=elm`*

^
Next months challenge is "Leap", where Given a year, report if it is a leap year.<br />
The tricky thing here is that a leap year in the Gregorian calendar occurs
- on every year that is evenly divisible by 4
- except every year that is evenly divisible by 100
- unless the year is also evenly divisible by 400
So, 1997 is not a leap year, but 1996 is, and 1900 is not a leap year, but 2000 is.

# [fit] **Thank you!**

^
Thanks so much to all the speakers tonight, and if anyone is interested in giving a talk at a future Elm Sydney...

---

# [fit] We are always looking for
# [fit] **SPEAKERS!**

^
We are looking for speakers!
- We want *you* to present something at Elm Sydney because presenting here is a win/win situation. You, the speaker, practice a skill and learn new things, and we, the audience, leverage your knowledge to learn new things that can potentially help us.<br />
- It's great public speaking practice in front of an audience that wants you to succeed because we're all here to learn cool new things, and...<br />
- Any talk you present here is great fodder for your resume and portfolio, and just by virtue of presenting, everyone will think you're an expert, which will surely lead to at least an endorsement on LinkedIn<br />
- So if you've got something to say, or to show and tell, that you think the Elm community would love to hear about...

# [fit] **Where do I sign up?**

# [fit] :globe_with_meridians: *`https://github.com/elmsydney/elmsydney/issues`*

^
- Open up an issue at the new Elm Sydney Github repo and tell us about the talk you want to submit, or feel free to message any of the organisers.<br />
- Remember, It is *good* to throw yourself out of your comfort zone and try
something different, and who knows, you might even end up liking it and wanting
to do more.<br />
- Also, if you need any help creating or critiquing your presentation or want someone to do a dry run, then please feel free to approach any of the Elm Sydney organisers and we're happy to help you in any way we can to make you look awesome up on stage.
